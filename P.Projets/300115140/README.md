I installed the ArangoDB on my desktop first. The free and open source version (community edition) can be found here:
https://www.arangodb.com/download-major/

The IP address used to connect from the Desktop Browser will be : http://127.0.0.1:8529 (the port used for Arango is 8529)

The default Login would be root and the default database would be system as shown below:
